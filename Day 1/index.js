// Difference Between let and var in JS

// This var

var b = 10;
console.log(b);

a = 12;
console.log(a);
var a;

// The Var is working with both which means you can declare the variable before you use and after too :);

let c = 10;
console.log(c);

d = 12;
console.log(d);
let d;

// But but this is not working with let :(
